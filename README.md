# Model Description

In this project, a Linear Regression machine learning model is employed to assist an Ecommerce company based in New York City. The company, which offers both online and in-store clothing services, is facing a strategic decision on whether to prioritize the improvement of its mobile app or website. To address this dilemma, the model analyzes data related to customer sessions, personal stylist interactions, and subsequent purchase behaviors. By leveraging Linear Regression, the algorithm uncovers patterns and relationships within the data, enabling the company to make informed decisions about optimizing either the mobile app or website experience. This predictive approach empowers the company to strategically allocate resources and enhance the platform that will yield the most significant impact on customer engagement and satisfaction.
